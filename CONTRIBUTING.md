# Contributing to the development of python-polylith

Fork this repo, write code and send a pull request. Easy!

### Guidelines
* Create a branch for the feature you are about to write.
* If possible, isolate the changes in the branch to the feature only. Merges will be easier if general refactorings, that are not specific to the feature, are made in separate branches.
* If possible, avoid general dependency updates in the feature branch.
* If possible, send pull requests early. Don't wait too long, even if the feature is not completely done. The new code can very likely be merged without causing any problems (if the code changes are not of type breaking features). Think of it as "silent releases".
* If you think it is relevant and adds value: write unit test(s).
