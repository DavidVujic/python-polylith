# :sparkles: Python tools for the Polylith Architecture :sparkles:

A repo containing tooling support for the Polylith Architecture in Python.

## What's Polylith? :confused:
From the [official docs](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/):

>... Polylith is a software architecture that applies functional thinking at the system scale. It helps us build simple, maintainable, testable, and scalable backend systems. ...

Polylith is an architecture (with tooling support) originally built for Clojure. The code in this repo brings __Polylith to Python!__

### An Architecture well suited for Monorepos
Polylith is using a components-first architecture. Similar to LEGO, components are building blocks.
A component can be shared across apps, serverless functions and microservices.

## Polylith for Python? :snake:
This repo contains a Poetry plugin, that you can install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-polylith-plugin).
The plugin will add Polylith specific tooling support to Poetry.
Have a look in the [Poetry Polylith Plugin project folder](projects/poetry_polylith_plugin/README.md) with details about the Poetry plugin.

### Use cases

#### Microservices and apps :thumbsup:
The main use case is to support having one or more microservices (or apps) in a Monorepo, and share code between the services.

#### Libraries? :thinking:
Polylith for Python isn't mainly for building libraries published to PyPI, even if it is supported.
Consider that the code in one library will share the same top namespace with other libraries that are
built from the same Polylith Monorepo. This will likely be a problem when _more than one_ of your libraries would be installed into the same virtual environment.

There is [a way to solve this](https://github.com/DavidVujic/poetry-multiproject-plugin#usage-for-libraries) issue, though. :smiley:


## :sparkles: Examples :sparkles:
Have a look at the [Python Polylith Examples](https://github.com/DavidVujic/python-polylith-example) repository.
It is a repository with an example __Python__ setup of the Polylith Architecture.
You will find examples of sharing code between different kind of projects, and developer tooling setup such as `mypy` and the `venv`.

### Differences between the Clojure & Python implementations
In the [official docs](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/) for the Clojure implementation,
there is a `interface.clj` file that is used to separate an API from the implementation of a component.

The Python implementation uses the `__init__.py` to accomplish that. In the Python implementation, the `pyproject.toml` is used to define bases and components.
In particular, the `packages` property is used for that.

This is an example of the _top level_ `pyproject.toml` used when _developing_. This is where you add all bricks (components and bases).

``` shell
 packages = [
    {include = "development"},
    {include = "my_namespace/my_component", from = "components"},
    {include = "my_namespace/my_example_aws_lambda", from = "bases"},
]
```
(using the `loose` theme, see the [Poetry Polylith Plugin docs](projects/poetry_polylith_plugin/README.md))

When creating a project, the project specific `pyproject.toml` will include all the used components and bases.
Note that the packages are referenced relative to the project.

This is where you add the bricks used by the actual project.

``` shell
 packages = [
    {include = "my_namespace/my_component", from = "../../components"},
    {include = "my_namespace/my_example_aws_lambda", from = "../../bases"},
]
```
