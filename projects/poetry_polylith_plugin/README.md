# Poetry Polylith Plugin

This is a Python `Poetry` plugin, adding CLI support for the Polylith Architecture.


## What's Polylith?
From the [official docs](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/):

>... Polylith is a software architecture that applies functional thinking at the system scale. It helps us build simple, maintainable, testable, and scalable backend systems. ...

Polylith is an architecture (with tooling support) originally built for Clojure.
With this Poetry plugin, Polylith is available in Python too!

### An Architecture well suited for Monorepos
Polylith is using a components-first architecture. Similar to LEGO, components are building blocks.
A component can be shared across apps, tools, libraries, serverless functions and services.


### Differences between the Clojure & Python implementations
In the [official docs](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/) for the Clojure implementation,
there is a `interface.clj` file that is used to separate an API from the implementation of a component.

The Python implementation uses the `__init__.py` to accomplish that. In the Python implementation, the `pyproject.toml` is used to define bases and components.
In particular, the `packages` property is used for that.

This is an example of the _top level_ `pyproject.toml` used when _developing_. This is where you add all bricks (components and bases).

``` shell
 packages = [
    {include = "development"},
    {include = "my_namespace/my_component", from = "components"},
    {include = "my_namespace/my_example_aws_lambda", from = "bases"},
]
```
(using the `loose` theme, see more about that below)

When creating a project, the _project specific_ `pyproject.toml` will include all the used components and bases.
Note that the packages are referenced relative to the project. This is made possible by the Multiproject Poetry plugin.

This is where you add the bricks used by the actual project.

``` shell
 packages = [
    {include = "my_namespace/my_component", from = "../../components"},
    {include = "my_namespace/my_example_aws_lambda", from = "../../bases"},
]
```

## Usage

### Install Poetry & plugins
With the `Poetry` version 1.2 or later installed, you can add plugins.

Add the [Multiproject](https://github.com/DavidVujic/poetry-multiproject-plugin) plugin, that will enable the very important __workspace__ support to Poetry.
``` shell
poetry plugin add poetry-multiproject-plugin
```

Add the Polylith plugin:
``` shell
poetry plugin add poetry-polylith-plugin
```

### Create a repository
Create a directory for your code, initialize it with __git__ and create a basic __Poetry__ setup:

``` shell
git init

poetry init
```

### Commands
The `create workspace` command will create a Polylith workspace, with a basic Polylith folder structure.


#### Create
``` shell
poetry poly create workspace --name my_namespace --theme <tdd or loose>
```

*New:* `theme` is a new Python Polylith feature and defines what kind of component structure - or theme - to use.

`tdd` is the default and will set the structure according to the original Polylith Clojure implementation, such as:
`components/<package>/src/<namespace>/<package>` with a corresponding `test` folder.

`loose` is a new theme, for a more familiar structure for Python:
`components/<namespace>/<package>` and will put a `test` folder at the root of the repository.


Add a component:

``` shell
# This command will create a component - i.e. a Python package in a namespaced folder.
poetry poly create component --name my_component
```

Add a base:

``` shell
# This command will create a base - i.e. a Python package in a namespaced folder.
poetry poly create base --name my_example_aws_lambda
```

Add a project:

``` shell
# This command will create a project - i.e. a pyproject.toml in a project folder. No code in this folder.
poetry poly create project --name my_example_aws_lambada_project
```

#### Info
Show info about the workspace:

``` shell
poetry poly info
```

Shows what has changed since the most recent stable point in time:

``` shell
poetry poly diff
```

The `diff` command will compare the current state of the repository, compared to a `git tag`.
The tool will look for the latest tag according to a certain pattern, such as `stable-*`.
The pattern can be configured in `workspace.toml`.

The `diff` command is useful in a CI environment, to determine if a project should be deployed or not.
The command has a `--short` flag to only print a comma separated list of changed projects to the standard output.


Useful for CI:
``` shell
poetry poly diff --short
```

#### Testing
The `create` commands will also create corresponding unit tests. It is possible to disable thi behaviour
by setting `enabled = false` in the `workspace.toml` file.


#### Workspace configuration
An example of a workspace configuration:

``` shell
[tool.polylith]
namespace = "my_namespace"
git_tag_pattern = "stable-*"

[tool.polylith.structure]
theme = "loose"

[tool.polylith.test]
enabled = true
```
